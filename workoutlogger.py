#This is an example file to show how to make use of pyrow
# The code waits until an erg is connected.
# Then it continues to record individual workouts until a keyboard interrupt

#NOTE: This code has not been thoroughly tested and may not function as advertised.
#Please report and findings to the author so that they may be addressed in a stable release.

# To Do
# Elapsed time decreases in time based intervals
